# ESP32-DHT22-Thingsboard
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 to read temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor and send the collected data to Thingsboard, an open-source IoT platform. The ESP32 connects to WiFi, retrieves sensor data at regular intervals, and transmits it via HTTP or MQTT to a Thingsboard instance for visualization and monitoring.
